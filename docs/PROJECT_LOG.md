## Current state

**Released:** `v0.1.0-alpha.1` (tag → commit `0246b50f`, GitHub Release published)
**Branch state:** `master` is the only active branch; all Alpha 1 feature
branches merged. Latest commit at the time of writing: `0bc715e1`.
**Production:** `relay.phntm.pro` running master, `phntm.pro/terms` and
`/privacy` serving themed HTML in EN + RU.
**Licensing:** AGPL-3.0-or-later established as the formal project
licence (LICENSE + NOTICE + SPDX headers on every .kt and .rs file +
README §License — all shipped in the four-commit licence-hygiene
patch on 2026-04-27).

### What works (proven in QA-v10 / 2026-04-27)

- ✅ End-to-end encrypted 1:1 messaging (libsignal + libsodium, Double Ratchet, Sealed Sender)
- ✅ Trust Tier flow (first message → Message Requests, accept → Trusted)
- ✅ Production relay with store-and-forward at `wss://relay.phntm.pro/ws`
- ✅ QR code + `phantom://invite/<base64>` deep links
- ✅ Crypto integration test suite green (16/16 on Pixel 8 Pro / API 35)
- ✅ Foreground-service WebSocket with WifiLock + partial WakeLock
- ✅ Onboarding ToS in EN, full Terms / Privacy Policy hosted at `/terms` and `/privacy` with EN ⇄ RU switcher
- ✅ Settings → About with all 6 contact addresses (security/support/privacy/legal/abuse/press)
- ✅ Chat input bar inset handling fixed across Tecno HiOS and stock Android (root cause: `enableEdgeToEdge()` instead of `setDecorFitsSystemWindows`)

### Known limitations (documented)

See [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](../KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the full
register. Headline items:

- ⚠️ **ISSUE-001** Tecno HiOS / aggressive-OEM Android skins reconnect every ~60 s due to OS-level Wi-Fi radio parking. **Mitigated** to 1–3 s message-delivery latency through WakeLock, OkHttp `pingInterval(8s)`, `forceCancelAllEngineCalls`, `cancelAndJoin`. **Real fix** scheduled for Alpha 2 via Unified Push (FOSS, no Google).
- No iOS / desktop / web client.
- No voice/video calls (scaffolding present, signalling not wired into UI).
- No attachments.
- No groups (state machine + Sender Keys crypto present, not on the Alpha 1 surface).
- No Tor / BLE / Wi-Fi Direct transport.

## Active backlog

The four GitHub Issues drafted in
[`docs/alpha2-backlog.md`](alpha2-backlog.md)
are the Alpha 2 priority queue:

1. **Onboarding ToS review** — final wording approval after lawyer / GDPR review.
2. **Per-message status indicators** (Sending / Sent / Delivered / Read) — wire signals already exist on the relay path; UI bug is purely client-side.
3. **Encrypted profile sync** (Alpha 2 protocol slice) — first/last name and bio visible to contacts; new `ProfileUpdate` envelope type.
4. **Locale-aware date-of-birth picker** — replace plain text field with proper `DatePickerDialog`, locale-aware display formats.

Also tracked:

- ⏳ Legal review by qualified attorney (Wyoming / US privacy law)
- ⏳ GDPR review for EU compliance (Art. 13/14 disclosures)
- ⏳ Russian translation review for legal-terminology accuracy
- ✅ ~~`LICENSE` file at repo root matching the AGPL-3.0 intent of [ADR-006](adr/ADR-006-Crypto-Library-Decision.md)~~ shipped 2026-04-27 (`e99aac0e` + `c403b7cf` + `27cd9bd1` + `0bc715e1`)
- ⏳ NLnet grant submission (deadline 2026-06-01)
- ⏳ Locale-aware in-app linking from Onboarding to `/terms/ru` / `/privacy/ru` based on `Locale.getDefault()` (currently always English)

## Decision log

This section records **rejected** options as well as accepted ones —
otherwise we would re-litigate the same conversations every few weeks.

### Accepted: SHA-1 application restriction for Firebase API key (instead of full key regeneration)

**Date:** 2026-05-08
**Context:** Phase 1 repo cleanup (commit `f07bba8c` + follow-up
`9b0581dd`) removed `apps/android/google-services.json` from git
tracking, but the live Firebase API key shipped inside that file was
publicly visible in every commit between project inception and the
cleanup PR. Two paths to mitigate:

- **A.** Restrict the existing key by Android package name + signing
  certificate SHA-1 fingerprints (debug + release). The leaked key
  remains usable, but only from APKs signed with our keystores. Other
  callers see `403 API_KEY_RESTRICTED`.
- **B.** Regenerate the key entirely. The leaked one is fully
  invalidated; clients with the old key (i.e. every existing PHANTOM
  install) lose FCM push until they receive an updated APK with a fresh
  `google-services.json`.

**Decision:** Path A (restrict, do not regenerate).

**Why:**

- Firebase keys are publishable by design — the Android SDK literally
  bundles them into every APK that ships, so they are extractable from
  any release with `apksigner` + a hex editor. The threat is not
  secrecy, it is *abuse*: someone using our key to exhaust our FCM
  quota and DoS our push channel. Application restriction
  (Android-package + signing-cert SHA-1) is the canonical mitigation
  Google itself recommends.
- Path B's blast radius hits real users: every install in the field
  loses push notifications until they update. Pre-Alpha-2 user count
  is small but non-zero, and the disruption is asymmetric to the
  threat (we have no evidence the key was actually scraped).
- Restoring the security posture is now reversible — if we later see
  abuse on the leaked key, we can still execute Path B (regenerate)
  without losing any of today's restriction work.

**Implementation:**

- Generated SHA-1 fingerprints from both keystores via `keytool -list -v`:
    - Debug (`~/.android/debug.keystore`):
      `B2:9E:30:6F:1F:77:83:AB:83:76:E3:EE:DB:AA:D2:AE:98:6D:74:5A`
    - Release (`keystores/phantom-release.keystore`):
      `A3:2B:94:CA:3A:85:C6:A1:CF:0E:8F:48:A2:86:C5:D9:64:AE:61:D9`
- Added both as Android-app application restrictions on the Firebase
  auto-created Android API key in Google Cloud Console
  (`console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=phantom-app-a1ca0`).
- Also added the matching SHA-256 fingerprints to the Firebase Console
  app registration page (defence in depth — Firebase Auth, Dynamic
  Links, App Check use these for client-attestation independently of
  the API-key restriction above).

**Follow-up:** if `gradle :apps:android:signingReport` ever shows a
new SHA-1 fingerprint (e.g. release keystore rotated, additional CI
signing key introduced), it must be added to both the Google Cloud
Console restriction and the Firebase Console app registration *before*
distributing the new APK. Otherwise that build will hit
`403 API_KEY_RESTRICTED` on first FCM register.

### Rejected: server-side Tor outbound for Stage 5E (Path B)

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Context:** Stage 5E's Hetzner Xray VLESS+REALITY server needs to forward
the unwrapped client traffic somewhere. Two architectures were on the
table — Path A (forward straight to clearnet `relay.phntm.pro` on the
same VPS via docker bridge DNS) and Path B (run a local Tor inside the
Xray container, route through a `.onion` to the relay).
**Why rejected:**

- Path B adds 500–800 ms per WebSocket frame on top of the REALITY
  handshake — unacceptable for messenger UX.
- The defence-in-depth Path B promises (Hetzner Xray operator can't
  correlate `client X → relay Y`) is moot because the Hetzner Xray
  operator IS the relay operator. Same VPS, same hand on the keyboard.
- Adds another daemon (Tor) to the production stack — more attack
  surface, more maintenance, more failure modes for the on-call rotation.

**Replacement:** Path A — `dns.hosts: {"relay.phntm.pro": "caddy"}` in
the Xray server config sends VLESS-tunnelled traffic straight to the
Caddy container over the docker bridge network. Zero NAT hairpin, zero
extra latency. Acceptable trade because external observers see only the
REALITY-mimicked Microsoft TLS handshake; the relay-operator-as-attacker
threat is out of scope for this server (it's defended at the Double
Ratchet layer instead — relay sees only ciphertext).

**See:** session entry for 2026-05-07 (Stage 5E production-validated).

### Rejected: FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for push-on-disconnect

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Context:** Tecno HiOS reconnects every ~60 s. FCM would let the relay
push silent data wakes to the device when the WS dies, eliminating
client-side reconnect cost.
**Why rejected:**

- FCM token = Google-issued stable trackable identifier per install. Adding
  it to PHANTOM puts a Google-known identifier on every account, which
  contradicts ADR-001 (zero-third-party-metadata) and the entire
  "we cannot disclose what we do not have" posture in the Privacy Policy.
- Each push = metadata event Google sees: "device X received PHANTOM message at time T".
- NLnet specifically funds privacy/freedom tech. A Google dependency in
  the core delivery path damages the grant story.
- Self-hosters of the relay would be forced to provision a Firebase project.

**Replacement plan:** **Unified Push** (FOSS protocol, ntfy.sh / gotify
distributors, no central provider). Scheduled for Alpha 2.

**See:** session entry for 2026-04-27 (FCM scaffold removed in
uncommitted local work; never reached master).

### Rejected: server-driven heartbeat Text frame (commit `22a76c22` reverted in `b2447dde`)

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Context:** Tried to keep cellular DPI / firewalls happy by having the
relay send `{"type":"heartbeat","ts":<unix>}` every 30 s as visible
application traffic.
**Why reverted:**

- Did not fix the Tecno-HiOS case (carrier DPI was never the cause —
  see "OEM Wi-Fi radio parking" finding below).
- Introduced a regression on the previously stable Pixel emulator: with
  the heartbeat branch in `tokio::select!` interleaving with
  `socket.next()` / `socket.send()`, the emulator's WebSocket started
  dropping after ~3 minutes (37 successful pings then a
  SocketTimeoutException). Almost certainly a subtle interaction with how
  the actor drains pending writes during heavy bidirectional traffic.

**Lesson:** when one mitigation does not work, **revert it and re-test**
before stacking another mitigation on top. Two mitigations interacting
hide root causes.

### Accepted: input-clipping root fix is `enableEdgeToEdge()`, not `setDecorFitsSystemWindows`

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Context:** Earlier the chat input slid under the 3-button nav bar on
Tecno HiOS. Two attempts to fix it via Compose `Modifier.windowInsetsPadding`
both failed.
**Root cause:** `WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(window, false)`
turns on edge-to-edge **drawing** but does not install the
`OnApplyWindowInsetsListener` Compose needs for `WindowInsets.ime` /
`WindowInsets.navigationBars` to be populated. The Pixel emulator
installed that listener as a side effect of other init paths so things
worked by accident. Tecno HiOS does not, so every
`Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(...)` resolved to zero.
**Fix:** replaced with `enableEdgeToEdge()` (the AndroidX-managed wrapper
that combines the decor-fits flag with the inset listener Compose
expects), guarded to API < 35 because on API 35+ the system enforces it
and re-calling corrupts the EGL surface.
**See:** commit `d2320b95`.

### Accepted: `socket.split()` was the relay's PONG-flush bug

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Context:** Even after fixing the client-side OkHttp graceful-close
60-second hang (`b14b39ff` → `2ee1d08d`), the phone was still dropping
its WebSocket on a deterministic 60-second cycle.
**Root cause:** Ktor's `OkHttpWebsocketSession.outgoing` is an actor
whose internal `WebSocket` is a local variable, not a field. The actor's
finally block calls `websocket.close()` (graceful) which blocks for
OkHttp's hardcoded `CANCEL_AFTER_CLOSE_MILLIS = 60_000L`. On the relay
side, splitting the WebSocket into `(Sink, Stream)` halves means the
auto-PONG enqueued by tungstenite when a PING arrives only flushes
on the next *write* through the Sink half — which never happens during
idle.
**Fix:** replaced relay's `socket.split()` + two spawned tasks with a
single `tokio::select!` loop that reads frames AND writes frames from
the same future, with explicit `socket.send(Message::Pong(payload))` on
every received PING.
**See:** commit `dbd9393c`. This was the breakthrough.

### Accepted: `Releases/` folder pattern for canonical release artefacts

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Files:**
- `Releases/README.md` — public-facing project README
- `Releases/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — what's in the release
- `Releases/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — limitations register
- `Releases/GITHUB_RELEASE_BODY.md` — template for `gh release` body
- `Releases/GITHUB_ISSUES_DRAFT.md` — Alpha 2 issue bodies ready to paste

**Why a separate folder:** the root `README.md` is the internal "Claude
Code + VS Code Pack" guide that the founder uses to bootstrap their
local agent setup. Replacing it with the product README would break the
founder's tooling. `Releases/` keeps both worlds clean.

> **Superseded 2026-04-28.** The `Releases/` folder was retired. Public
> artefacts moved to repo-root standard locations (`README.md`,
> `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`); the GitHub Release-body
> template and the issues-draft moved into `docs/release-drafts/` and
> `docs/alpha2-backlog.md` respectively. The Claude Code + VS Code Pack
> guide that used to occupy the root `README.md` was deleted (no longer
> needed in the public repo — it described the founder's local agent
> tooling, not the product). `Releases/` was also stripped from git
> history via `git-filter-repo` so the public repo presents a clean
> tree.

## Lessons learned

Technical findings worth remembering across sessions.

### Compose insets on OEM Android skins

`Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.ime ⋃ WindowInsets.navigationBars)`
is the right way to pad a screen for both keyboard and system nav bar:
the `union` gives the per-side max so they never stack. **But** the
modifier resolves to zero unless the Activity has called
`enableEdgeToEdge()` (or the older deprecated equivalent). Without that,
inset values are not propagated to Compose by some OEM Android builds —
the Pixel emulator hides this by installing the listener through other
code paths.

### Ktor 3.0.3 OkHttp engine close behaviour

- `session.close()` triggers OkHttp's graceful-close path: send WS CLOSE
  frame, wait up to 60 s for the peer's matching CLOSE before tearing
  down the socket. This is the source of the QA-v3 60-second-hang
  pattern.
- `session.cancel()` is closer to right, but the OkHttp actor's
  `finally { websocket.close(...) }` still runs and blocks.
- The reliable escape hatch is to call `OkHttpClient.dispatcher.cancelAll()`
  on the *engine* — that fires `onFailure`, the actor's finally then
  sees a failed websocket and returns instantly. We expose this through
  an `expect/actual` `forceCancelAllEngineCalls()` plumbed into
  `KtorRelayTransport`.

### Stale coroutines across reconnect generations

When a generation's `pingJob` lives in a `transportScope` that the
`webSocket {}` block fails to cancel via the normal exit path (e.g.
exception path), the next generation's session can be force-cancelled
by the *previous* generation's pingJob firing late. Symptom: cascades of
"Pong timeout" log lines a few seconds after a successful reconnect.
**Pattern:** hoist the per-generation scope out of the `webSocket {}`
block and `cancelAndJoin` it in a `finally` — `cancel()` alone is
asynchronous and lets stale jobs race. Capture the session at launch
time into a local `val` so a stale job cannot read the *new* session
out of the field. Both fixes shipped in `846d6bed`.

### Caddy bind-mount semantics

`docker compose restart` does **not** pick up `volume:` changes. Only
`docker compose up -d --force-recreate` recreates the container with
the new mount config. Caddyfile changes alone (no volume change) do
get picked up by `restart` because the file is bind-mounted and Caddy
reloads on container start.

### Caddy `handle_path` matcher ordering

`handle_path /terms/ru*` MUST appear **before** `handle_path /terms*` —
Caddy matches in source order and the generic block would otherwise
swallow the localised path before the specific block sees it. Same for
`/privacy/ru*` vs `/privacy*`.

### Tecno HiOS aggressive power management

Even with a foreground service notification visible AND a partial
WakeLock AND a high-perf WifiLock, Tecno HiOS still drops the
WebSocket every ~60 s. Per the user's testing, no amount of in-app
mitigation fully fixes this — only push-on-disconnect (Alpha 2) will.
Documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.md as ISSUE-001 with a Tecno-specific
workaround section (Battery → Unrestricted, etc.).

### Don't trust hallucinated git history from a separate Claude

A consultant Claude session repeatedly claimed fixes existed on
specific branches that did not (`Update Dockerfile for Rust 1.88` etc.).
Always verify with `git log --all --oneline -- <path>` before acting
on advice that references prior commits — even from another LLM.

### 2026-05-08 (thu) · Day 1 of council-revised 25-day plan to NLnet — Stage 5 closure + Phase 1 cleanup + Firebase rotation + ADR-019

- **Goal:** close all loose ends from yesterday's Stage 5E.B production
  validation, kick off the council-revised 25-day path to NLnet
  submission (target submit day 15 = 2026-05-22, leaving ~10-day buffer
  before the 2026-06-01 deadline). Day 1 specifically: restore strict
  Xray routing on the Hetzner server (which had been left in
  diagnostic-relaxed state by yesterday's `7b4ebf77`); ship Track C
  Phase 1 repo cleanup (the live Firebase API key was tracked publicly
  until today); rotate the Firebase key now that it is out of git
  tracking; write ADR-019 capturing the architectural decision behind
  the whole Stage 5E build.
- **Outcomes (four merged PRs in one day):**
  - **Restore strict Xray routing** (#45, commit `d7ba3a41`). Replaced
    the diagnostic single-rule (`VLESS in → freedom out`) with a
    three-rule chain: domain matches `relay.phntm.pro` (with three
    matcher syntaxes layered — `relay.phntm.pro`, `domain:`, `full:` —
    so whichever variant Xray 26.3.27's matcher honours wins) → port
    443 fallback → catchall blackhole. Closes the open-proxy hole.
    Verified end-to-end via Caddy access logs:
    `remote_ip: 172.18.0.7` (docker bridge) means traffic landed
    through Xray, not direct.
  - **Phase 1 repo cleanup** (#46, commits `f07bba8c` + `9b0581dd`).
    `git rm --cached` for `apps/android/google-services.json` (live
    Firebase API key) and `.kotlin/` (76 Kotlin Multiplatform metadata
    cache files). Newly tracked: `docs/project/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS_TODO.md`
    and `docs/project/PHANTOM_ROADMAP_2026.md` (both internal until
    now, Vladislav approved publication for grant-readiness signal).
    `.gitignore` extended with `.mcp.json`, `.kotlin/`,
    `apps/android/google-services.json`, `tag-message.txt`,
    `private/`, and a `*.pdf` blanket with
    `!legal/assets/*.pdf` + `!docs/**/*.pdf` exceptions. The
    follow-up `9b0581dd` made the google-services Gradle plugin
    conditional (`apply false` + later `if (...exists()) apply(...)`)
    so clean-clone CI builds succeed without the Firebase config
    file. Verified: `./gradlew :apps:android:assembleDebug` passed
    in both states (with and without the file present).
  - **Firebase API key SHA-1 restriction logged** (#47, commit
    `ba830353`). Decision-log entry in `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md`
    documenting the Path-A-vs-Path-B reasoning (restrict by
    package name + signing-cert SHA-1, not full key regeneration —
    full reasoning in the Decision log entry above this one).
    Operator action (the actual restriction in Google Cloud Console)
    completed in parallel: two SHA-1 fingerprints (debug + release)
    added to the auto-created Android API key, plus matching
    SHA-256 fingerprints registered in Firebase Console for
    defence-in-depth (Firebase Auth / App Check / Dynamic Links
    use these independently of API-key restriction).
  - **ADR-019 Xray VLESS+REALITY as outer transport** (#48, commit
    `20e71fbb`). 371-line architectural decision record covering
    context (Stage 5C/5D bridge failure on Hetzner *and* FlokiNET
    on RU MTS), decision (libXray gomobile + Path A server),
    five sub-rationale subsections (why VLESS+REALITY beats
    every obfuscation alternative, why same VPS as relay, why
    in-process libXray, why single shared capability-style UUID,
    why MPL-2.0 + AGPL aggregation is OK), threat-model
    consequences, known limitations (each tied to a planned
    mitigation ADR — 020 adaptive transport, 021 multi-server
    fan-out, 022 iOS XCFramework), implementation plan (lists
    the five Stage 5E commit chains as DONE), production-validated
    test plan, and references. Will anchor the Stage 5E pitch in
    the NLnet application body.
- **Decisions captured:** the Firebase rotation decision (Path A
  restrict vs Path B regenerate) is in `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md`
  Decision log section, written today as part of #47.
- **Discoveries / lessons that nearly cost time:**
  - "Phantom not using Xray" red herring (~30 min). When Xray's
    `docker logs phantom-xray` showed only startup messages with no
    accepted-connection lines after a real client connect, the
    instinct was "Phantom bypasses Xray, OkHttp SOCKS proxy bug".
    The actual cause: `access: none` in the Xray log block (added
    yesterday as a security-reviewer finding) intentionally
    disables per-connection logging. Routing was always fine — we
    just had to look at Caddy access logs (`remote_ip` field)
    instead. Captured as a permanent reference in
    `memory/reference_xray_diagnostics.md` so the same time-sink
    doesn't repeat.
  - VPN-on-host vs VPN-on-emulator confusion. Tested Xray on the
    Pixel 8 Pro emulator while Borealis VPN was still active on
    Windows host. Emulator inherits host networking, so the
    "Xray ready" notification was technically correct (local SOCKS
    bound) but no traffic actually went through Xray to the Hetzner
    server (the host VPN intercepted all TCP). Spent ~10 min ruling
    out a code bug before realising it was test-environment
    contamination. Stage 5E architecturally cannot stack with
    another VLESS-based VPN like Borealis — REALITY needs a direct
    TLS-fingerprint path to the cover host.
- **Council session and the revised 25-day plan.** Last night
  (2026-05-07 evening, after the Stage 5E production-validation
  sign-off) I ran a five-advisor LLM Council session on "what's the
  optimal sequencing of the next 25 days to maximise NLnet odds
  without burning out the founder". All five lenses converged on a
  significant pivot from the original plan: cut Track B Security
  Sprint from 4 items to 1 (F22 only — keystore-wrap SPK/OPK), move
  the remaining findings into a `docs/security/SECURITY_ROADMAP.md`
  honest-roadmap document, ship Stage 5E demo video on day 3 (one
  artefact serving NLnet body + README hero + public write-up),
  submit NLnet on day 15 with a 10-day buffer rather than the
  last-minute day-25 push. Full synthesis in
  `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/council_2026_05_07_nlnet_synthesis.md`,
  daily plan in `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/plan_25_days_to_nlnet.md`.
  Today (Day 1) executed the Stage 5 closure + Phase 1 cleanup
  +Firebase rotation + ADR-019 leg of that plan.
- **Day 2 next** (Friday 2026-05-09): README polish (License → AGPL,
  Status → Alpha 2, hero line about Stage 5E in the first three
  lines), `funding.json` (FLOSS/fund mandatory), `.github/FUNDING.yml`,
  and matching fixes to `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  ~3 hours estimated.
- **Day 3 after that:** demo video for Stage 5E (5-10 min screen
  capture showing Tecno on RU MTS without VPN, plus emulator twin,
  plus Caddy log proof). ~3-4 hours.
- **Follow-ups from today not blocking Day 2:**
  - The Firebase Console SHA-1 fingerprints (defence-in-depth) were
    optional and Vladislav can add them whenever — not on the Day 2
    critical path.
  - `keystores/phantom-release.keystore` backup to off-device
    location is the single critical-asset backup the project does
    not yet have. Captured here so it doesn't get forgotten;
    Vladislav schedules at convenience.

### 2026-05-07 (wed) · Stage 5E (Xray VLESS+REALITY) production-validated

- **Goal:** Finish Stage 5E.B (the Android client side of ADR-018's
  Xray-as-outer-transport plan) and prove end-to-end that PHANTOM works
  on a Russian carrier without VPN, without Orbot, without any
  third-party app. The TSPU "16-kilobyte curtain" — silent throttling
  of TLS streams larger than ~16 KB to flagged datacenter IPs (Hetzner
  confirmed by Test 11/12 on 2026-05-05/06; FlokiNET confirmed by
  Test 13 on 2026-05-06) — had killed the Stage 5C/5D bridge approach
  entirely. Stage 5E mimics a genuine TLS handshake to
  `www.microsoft.com` so the censor classifies the flow as trusted CDN.
- **Outcomes:**
  - **`shared/core/xray/`** — new KMP module exposing
    `XrayService` / `XrayState` (Off/Starting/Ready(socksPort)/Failed),
    `XrayServiceConfig` data class, `OperatorXrayConfig` with the pinned
    REALITY pubkey + shortId + UUID for the Hetzner endpoint, and an
    Android impl that wraps libXray's gomobile JNI. JVM target gets a
    no-op stub. libXray itself (built via the new
    `.github/workflows/build-libxray.yml` workflow) is vendored unpacked
    as `classes.jar` + `libgojni.so` × 4 ABI under
    `src/androidMain/{libs,jniLibs}/` — AGP refuses to bundle a local
    `.aar` inside another AAR, so the four-file split is the canonical
    workaround. ~180 MB committed to git; reroll procedure in
    `src/androidMain/libs/README.md`. Commit `96fcbf1a`.
  - **`PhantomMessagingService` wiring** — `BuildConfig.USE_XRAY` flag
    added alongside `USE_TOR` with a build-time mutual-exclusion check
    (both true → gradle errors immediately). When `USE_XRAY=true`,
    service lazy-constructs Xray, awaits Ready-or-Failed within 30 s,
    hands the localhost SOCKS5 port to `KtorRelayTransport` via the
    same `socksProxyPort` parameter the Tor branch already uses.
    Notification updater extended to surface Xray state. Commit
    `98245f69`.
  - **Server-side Path A** (`deploy/xray/config.json.template` rewrite,
    commit `7b4ebf77` — see Decision log entry below): VLESS routing
    relaxed from strict-domain-match-then-blackhole to
    `inboundTag-only → freedom outbound`, because `domain: ["full:relay.phntm.pro"]`
    silently misses on Xray 26.3.27 even when sniffed SNI visibly equals
    `relay.phntm.pro` in the same log line. With the relaxed rule, plus
    a `dns.hosts` override (`relay.phntm.pro → caddy`) and `access: none`
    in the log block (the latter two folded in from a security-reviewer
    pass), VLESS clients land in the local Caddy container via the
    docker bridge network — no NAT hairpin, no `docker logs` IP leak.
  - **Test 14 (production validation, 2026-05-07 evening):** Tecno on RU
    MTS without VPN ↔ Pixel 8 Pro emulator. After clearing emulator
    storage (the long-standing prekey-bundle bug ate a fresh identity —
    see Follow-ups), text messages `delivered` in 30–100 ms each way;
    5-second voice messages chunked to 5 envelopes of ~55 KB each
    flowed through Xray REALITY with ack `delivered` on every chunk and
    clean `Decrypt OK` on the receiving side. The 55 KB chunk size is
    the critical proof: it is well over the 16 KB curtain threshold,
    bare TLS would have stalled, REALITY masks it as a Microsoft CDN
    stream and the censor passes it.
- **Decisions made:**
  - **Path A (VLESS clients land at clearnet `relay.phntm.pro` on the
    same VPS via docker DNS)** chosen over Path B (server-side Tor →
    onion). Path B would have added 500–800 ms latency and a second
    daemon for defence-in-depth that protects only against an insider
    on the Hetzner Xray container — and that container is the operator's
    own. Decision recorded in commit message `98245f69`.
  - **Single shared client UUID** baked into the APK, treated as a
    *capability* (anyone holding it can use the server) rather than a
    secret tied to identity. Stage 5E's purpose is censorship
    circumvention, not access control — relay-level auth handles abuse
    separately. Rotation playbook in
    `deploy/xray/render-config.sh` header.
  - **Vendor libXray as committed git artefacts** (not Git LFS, not
    fetch-on-build) — earlier we tried "don't commit, instruct
    contributors to download" but Vladislav rightly pointed out that
    creates a reproducibility hole and a bad first impression for the
    NLnet reviewer. 180 MB one-time cost is acceptable; rebuild from
    `XTLS/libXray@<sha>` is deterministic via the workflow.
- **Key commits (all on `feat/tor-stage5-bridges-via-onionwrapper`,
  pushed to origin, **NOT** yet merged to master):**
  - `5cca2976` — workflow `.github/workflows/build-libxray.yml`
  - `f5e21fb3` — workflow audit pass (Go pin, ABI regex, leading-./, SHA-ref fix)
  - `96fcbf1a` — KMP module skeleton + libXray vendoring (15 files, +644 lines + ~180 MB binaries)
  - `98245f69` — `PhantomMessagingService` wiring + Path A server template
  - `7b4ebf77` — diagnostic routing relaxation
- **Follow-ups:**
  - **Prekey republish bug** (pre-existing, surfaced by Stage 5
    testing). Long-offline identity → bundle 404 on `/prekeys/bundle/<peer>`
    → senders' messages stay WAITING forever. Workaround that worked
    today: Clear Data on the offline device → fresh onboarding →
    fresh publish. Permanent fix: client-side retry publish on
    connect when self-bundle is 404, or relay-side fallback to a
    signed-prekey-only bundle when OPK pool is empty. ~1–2 hours.
  - **Restore strict Xray routing** — replace the temporary
    `inboundTag-only` rule with `domain: ["domain:relay.phntm.pro"]`
    (without the `full:` prefix that silently missed) and re-enable
    blackhole-by-default. Server-side, ~30 min plus redeploy.
  - **ADR-019 Xray REALITY rationale** — write it before NLnet body
    needs it: threat model, license posture (MPL-2.0 Xray-core
    aggregation cleanly composable with our AGPL at the docker-compose
    level), Beta-time multi-server fan-out plan. ~1 hour.
  - **PR to master** — open once the three above are done, so master
    doesn't carry the temporarily relaxed routing.

### 2026-04-27 (sat, evening) · Licence hygiene before NLnet submission

- **Goal:** establish formal AGPL-3.0 licensing across the repo so the
  NLnet grant reviewer (deadline 2026-06-01) does not see absent /
  ambiguous licensing as a red flag. The user reported a perception
  that the previous LICENSE file carried a Vercel copyright (likely a
  half-remembered reference to the `prototype/web` Next.js scaffold);
  on inspection there was no top-level LICENSE at all, which is
  arguably worse for a grant submission.
- **Outcomes:** four-commit patch series shipped:
  1. **`e99aac0e`** — `LICENSE` at the repo root: PHANTOM header
     naming Willen LLC + Vladislav Liudvig (both 2026), the AGPL
     grant / warranty paragraph, and the verbatim 661-line GNU
     AGPL-3.0 text fetched from `gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt`.
  2. **`c403b7cf`** — SPDX headers on **121** source files (113 .kt
     + 8 .rs). Format: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later`
     and `// Copyright (c) 2026 Willen LLC`. Driven by a small
     idempotent helper `scripts/add-spdx-headers.py` that walks
     `apps/`, `shared/`, `services/`, skips build outputs, checks
     the first 5 lines for an existing SPDX tag before prepending.
     Verified clean by `cargo build --release` (3.56 s) and
     `:apps:android:compileDebugKotlinAndroid`.
  3. **`27cd9bd1`** — `NOTICE` listing every bundled / linked
     third-party dependency with upstream URL and licence: libsodium
     (ISC), Kotlin / kotlinx / Compose Multiplatform / AndroidX /
     Ktor / OkHttp / SQLDelight (Apache-2.0), SQLCipher (BSD 3-Clause),
     tokio / axum / tokio-tungstenite / tower / serde / tracing /
     futures-util (MIT), subtle (BSD 3-Clause), Caddy (Apache-2.0),
     Inter / JetBrains Mono (SIL OFL-1.1, mock-ups only — explicitly
     not bundled).
  4. **`0bc715e1`** — `Releases/README.md` §License updated from the
     "to be finalized" placeholder to the canonical AGPL-3.0 statement
     with rationale (relay-side §13 Remote Network Interaction
     protection) and a commercial-dual-licensing escape hatch contact.
- **Decision:** AGPL-3.0 over GPL-3.0 — recorded in the LICENSE
  commit message and now mirrored in `Releases/README.md` §License.
  See ADR-006 for the original rationale.
- **Follow-ups:**
  - Keep `scripts/add-spdx-headers.py` idempotent — re-run it any
    time new `.kt` / `.rs` files land. Could be wired into a pre-commit
    hook in a later session.
  - The four legal-doc TODOs (lawyer review, GDPR review, RU
    translation review, ownership approval) are unaffected by this
    licence work — they live in `legal/README.md` and remain on the
    Active backlog.

### 2026-04-27 (sat) · QA-v10 polish + RU localisation + correct Russian legal terminology

- **Goal:** Tecno-HiOS input clipping (third attempt), publish themed
  ToS / Privacy Policy at `phntm.pro/terms` and `/privacy`, add EN ⇄ RU
  language switcher, rename Russian "приватность" → "конфиденциальность".
- **Outcomes:**
  - Input clipping **fixed** at root cause: `enableEdgeToEdge()` for
    API < 35 in `MainActivity`. Verified on Tecno HiOS (the chat AND
    Notes screens). `SavedMessagesScreen` also got an explicit
    `windowInsetsPadding(ime ⋃ navigationBars)` since it has no
    Scaffold.
  - `legal/render.py` — stdlib-only Markdown → themed HTML generator.
    PHANTOM design tokens (Surface Deep, Cyan accent, system sans/mono
    stack — no Google Fonts CDN per privacy posture). Brand logo from
    `Claude Design/assets/phantom-logo.png` in header + footer.
  - Caddyfile: `/assets/*` for the logo, `/terms*` and `/privacy*` (EN
    default), `/terms/ru*` and `/privacy/ru*` (Russian, ordered before
    the generic blocks).
  - `docker-compose.yml`: bind-mount `legal/` at `/srv/legal:ro`.
  - Russian terminology pass: "Политика приватности" →
    "Политика конфиденциальности" across MD source, render.py
    LOCALES["ru"], and regenerated HTML. URL `/privacy/ru` unchanged
    (technical, stable).
- **Commits:** `b3629bed`, `09012ab1`, `99a93c41`, `d2320b95`, `f46d2772`,
  `b2056987`, `3d4b0bf8`.
- **Follow-ups:** legal/GDPR/translation reviews still on the TODO list
  (see Active backlog). Locale-aware in-app linking deferred — the
  in-page EN/RU switcher covers the immediate UX gap.

### 2026-04-27 (sat) · Alpha 1 release tagging + production redeploy

- **Goal:** ship Alpha 1 — tag, GitHub Release page, redeploy production
  relay on master.
- **Outcomes:**
  - `v0.1.0-alpha.1` tagged at the merge commit `0246b50f` and pushed.
  - GitHub Release page published with the signed `android-release.apk`
    attached, body taken from `Releases/GITHUB_RELEASE_BODY.md`
    (template committed alongside for reuse).
  - Production redeploy hit two latent bugs: `Dockerfile` sed only
    matched single-line `members = [...]` (workspace had grown to
    multi-line), and the bundled `time = 0.3.47` requires Rust 1.85+
    (image was on rust:1.83). Fixed both: `sed -z` for multi-line
    arrays (`a539695e`), bumped builder image to `rust:1.88-slim-bookworm`
    (`38b20f29`).
  - Three branches merged into master via `--no-ff`:
    `fix/bug-h-libsodium-jni` (everything from the QA sprint, plus
    `chore/assetlinks-real-fingerprint` which was already an ancestor),
    and `docs/initial-drafts` (NLnet-ready public docs).
- **Commits:** `0246b50f` (tag), `4d7d6091`, `01e955fe`, `a539695e`, `38b20f29`.
- **Follow-ups:** Alpha 2 polish items captured as drafts in
  `Releases/GITHUB_ISSUES_DRAFT.md`.

### 2026-04-26 / 04-27 (sun → mon) · 60-second WebSocket reconnect hunt

- **Goal:** chase down the deterministic ~60 s WebSocket disconnect
  cycle that QA-v3 → QA-v8 surfaced. Four false starts, one breakthrough.
- **Outcomes:**
  - **`b14b39ff`**: replace `session.close()` with `session.cancel()` on
    pong/ack timeout. Halved the close-wait but did not fix it — the
    Ktor actor's finally block was still calling graceful close.
  - **`2ee1d08d`**: introduced the `forceCancelAllEngineCalls()`
    expect/actual that calls OkHttp's `dispatcher.cancelAll()`. Bypasses
    the actor entirely. **Major progress** — emulator stopped hanging.
    Phone still cycled.
  - **`846d6bed`**: `cancelAndJoin` between reconnect generations to
    stop stale `pingJob`s from firing on the new socket. Removed the
    "cascade of Pong timeouts" log noise.
  - **`452a0b5e`**: tightened OkHttp `pingInterval` to 8 s and
    `RECONNECT_BASE_DELAY_MS` to 1 s.
  - **`dbd9393c`** (THE FIX): traced the relay-side bug to
    `socket.split()` + tungstenite's auto-PONG queue. Replaced with a
    single `tokio::select!` loop that explicitly answers `Message::Ping`.
    **Pixel emulator went from "every 90 s" to rock-solid for hours.**
  - **`74e6af0a`**: WifiLock + WakeLock for the foreground service.
    Helped some OEM cases but not Tecno HiOS — that's where it became
    clear the remaining issue is OS-level radio parking, not code.
  - **`22a76c22` → `b2447dde`**: the heartbeat experiment that did not
    work and was reverted (see Decision log).
- **Outcome:** stock-Android Wi-Fi connections are stable for hours;
  Tecno HiOS still drops every ~60 s but messages are durable through
  store-and-forward — fix-grade for Alpha 1, real solution scheduled
  for Alpha 2.

### 2026-04-25 (fri) · Onboarding sequence + false-offline badge

- **Goal:** the two non-network bugs surfaced in QA-v5: the WebSocket
  did not connect after the *first* onboarding (only after an app
  restart), and the "Offline — messages queued" banner showed during
  the cold-start window before any connect attempt had happened.
- **Outcomes (commit `5caf61eb`):**
  - `MainActivity.PhantomApp` now re-triggers `startForegroundService(...)`
    from the `OnboardingScreen.onComplete` callback. The service's
    earlier `onStartCommand` had bailed out via `stopSelf()` because
    no identity existed yet.
  - `ConnectionBanner` gates the offline line on a `hasEverConnected`
    flag set the first time `TransportState` transitions to
    `Connecting`/`Connected`.
- **Plus:** `69e87ad8` switched the debug build to default to
  `wss://relay.phntm.pro/ws` instead of a hardcoded LAN IP.

### 2026-04-25 (fri, earlier) · Six bugs from cross-device QA

- **Goal:** stabilise the relay + Android transport based on the
  2026-04-25 morning QA report.
- **Outcomes:** commit `37e1414e` rolls up six fixes:
  outbox `addLast` ordering, `withTimeoutOrNull` on session close,
  `processingLock` deduplication in `handleDeliver`, atomic `conn_id`
  for racing reconnects, exclude `/ws` from `tower-http`'s
  `TimeoutLayer(30s)`, remove Caddy `response_header_timeout 30s`.

### Earlier history

Pre-2026-04-25 work (Этап 2 security, KMP scaffold, deploy artefacts,
groups + Sender Keys, FCM scaffold, etc.) is out of scope for this
log because every fact lives in
[`docs/adr/`](adr/), [`docs/threat-model/`](threat-model/), and the
respective merge commits (`94b6a4d2`, `90a5ec54`, `4425fbda`, `084cd8e2`).
The first session worth tracking here is the QA-driven hardening that
produced Alpha 1.
